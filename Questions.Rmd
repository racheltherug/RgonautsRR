## Questions


1. How have shape characteristics important to flight evolved in the lepidoptera?
  
  
  -Pros: Big question, covers entire group
  -Cons: Too broad, not nec. mechanistic.
  
2. How have shape characteristics affected speciation?
      Are differences in wing morphology based on ecological/habitat differences? 
      Behavioral differences (migratory or defending one territory)? 
      Flying to escape predators/courtship?
      
  -Pros: Mechanistic---what's driven evolution? Cool to lots of lep folks
  -Cons: Just 200 representatives of a huge group. Need lots of caveats and could be preliminary
  
3. Why are there differences in fore and hindwing evolution? How are the two wings integrated in flight behavior and mechanics?
